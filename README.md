# pyHG

This program can take an input file formatted in the OT-Help input file format (see Example input file) with or without Hidden Structure, 
and learn the pattern using the Gradient Descent MaxEnt algorithm. 

It can also solve it analitically using the Linear Programming method (described in Potts et al 2010). 

You can try the program in the google colab demo.
